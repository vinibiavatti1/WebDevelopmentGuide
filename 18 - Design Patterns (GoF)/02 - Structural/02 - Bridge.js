// Bridge
// - Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. In
//   JavaScript, we can implement this functionally by injecting implementation functions directly
//   into higher-order factory functions.

//   [SMS to john] Alert: Server is down
//   [EMAIL to john] Alert: Server is down
