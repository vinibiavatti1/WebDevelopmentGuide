// State
// - Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. In JavaScript, we can
//   implement this functionally by delegating behavior to interchangeable state handler objects or
//   transition functions inside a closure context.
// - Output:
//   Draft: Document submitted for review
//   Moderation: Document published successfully
//   Published: Cannot edit published document
