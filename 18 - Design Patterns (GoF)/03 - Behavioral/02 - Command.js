// Command
// - Encapsulates a request as an object or function, letting you parameterize clients with
//   different requests, queue or log operations, and support undoable actions. In JavaScript, we
//   can implement this functionally using first-class functions or simple action objects with
//   execute and undo methods.
// - Output: File Opened | File Saved | File Closed
