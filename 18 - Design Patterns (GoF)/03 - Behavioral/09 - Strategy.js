// Strategy
// - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. In
//   JavaScript, we can implement this functionally by passing strategy functions directly or
//   selecting them from a lookup table inside a closure context.
// - Output:
//   Standard shipping: 10
//   Express shipping: 25
