// Chain Of Responsibility
// - Avoids coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance
//   to handle the request. In JavaScript, we can implement this functionally by executing an array
//   of handler functions in sequence until a handler halts the pipeline.
// - Output: HELLO WORLD

const pipe = (...fns) => data => fns.reduce((acc, fn) => fn(acc), data)
const trimHandler = data => data.trim()
const toUpperHandler = data => data.toUpperCase()
const pipeline = pipe(trimHandler, toUpperHandler)
console.log(pipeline(' hello world '))
