// Readline
// - Provides an interface for reading data from a readable stream (such as process.stdin) line by
//   line.

// Import
// - Imports the promise-based readline interface from Node.js core.

import { createInterface } from 'node:readline/promises'

// Create Interface
// - Initializes the readline instance by passing input and output streams as an options object.

const rl = createInterface(process.stdin, process.stdout)

// Question
// - Prompts the user and waits asynchronously for their input.
// - Output: John Doe

const answer = await rl.question('What is your name? ')
console.log(answer)

// Readline Line Event
// - Listens continuously for input lines from the user, processing each entry as they press Enter.
// - Output: Echoes back each typed line until closed.

rl.on('line', (line) => {
    console.log(`Received: ${line}`)
    if (line.trim() === 'exit') {
        rl.close()
    }
})

// Close
// - Closes the readline interface instance, releasing the control streams so the process can exit.

rl.close()
