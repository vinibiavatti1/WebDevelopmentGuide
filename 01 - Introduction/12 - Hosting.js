// Hosting
// - Hosting a Node.js application should be simple, low-cost, and quick to set up. Platforms
//   generally split into automated cloud services (PaaS) or custom cloud servers (VPS).
// - Deployment Strategies:
//   - PaaS (Platform as a Service): You push your code to GitHub, connect your repository to the
//     host, and it automatically builds, deploys, configures HTTPS, and runs your app. Zero server
//     maintenance required.
//   - VPS (Virtual Private Server): You rent a small Linux server (e.g., $4-$6/mo) and manually
//     install Node.js, Git, PM2 (process manager), and Nginx (reverse proxy). Requires server
//     configuration, but gives total control and fixed predictable costs.
//   - Enterprise / IaaS (AWS, GCP, Azure): High-end infrastructure designed for complex
//     microservices and large teams. Usually used for big and scalable projects.
// - Hosting Platforms:
//   - Render (PaaS): The modern free alternative to Heroku. Deploys directly from GitHub, offers
//     automated SSL, and includes a free tier (spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity). Includes
//     a free PostgreSQL database which expires after 90 days.
//   - Railway (PaaS): Excellent developer experience with instant deployments and built-in
//     databases (PostgreSQL, Redis). Generous trial usage with predictable pay-as-you-go pricing.
//   - Vercel / Netlify (Serverless): Best for fullstack Node.js apps (Next.js, Nuxt) or API
//     endpoints running as serverless functions. Extremely fast and free for personal projects.
//   - DigitalOcean / Hetzner (VPS): Ideal if you need to host multiple Node.js apps, databases, and
//     cron jobs on a single cheap $4-$6/mo Linux virtual machine without free-tier limitations.
