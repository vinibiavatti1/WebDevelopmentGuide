// ECMAScript
// - ECMAScript (often abbreviated as ES) is the official scripting language specification that
//   JavaScript is built upon. While JavaScript is the programming language you actually write and
//   run, ECMAScript is the official rulebook or standard that defines how JavaScript should work,
//   what features it has, and how they behave.
// - Relationship with Node.js:
//   - Node.js relies on the V8 JavaScript engine (developed by Google) to execute code.
//   - As the V8 engine updates to support newer ECMAScript standards (like ES6 / ES2015 and
//     beyond), Node.js gains support for modern features (such as arrow functions, promises,
//     async/await, and modules).
// - The Evolution of Modules in Node.js (require vs. import):
//   - In the early days, JavaScript lacked an official module standard. Node.js created its own
//     system called CommonJS, using 'require()' to load files and 'module.exports' to share them.
//   - Browsers later adopted a different standard created by the official ECMAScript committee: ES
//     Modules, using 'import' and 'export'.
//   - For a long time, Node.js only supported CommonJS. However, modern Node.js now fully supports
//     native ECMAScript Modules (ESM) by setting `"type": "module"` in your package.json or by
//     using the `.mjs` file extension.

// Examples
//==================================================================================================

// Older syntax style (ES5)
// - The example below shows a normal function declaration.

function sayHello(name) {
    return 'Hello' + name;
}

// Modern ECMAScript style (ES6+)
// - The example below shows an arrow function declaration (released in ES6).

const sayHello = (name) => `Hello ${name}`;
