// Event Loop Architecture
// - The Event Loop is the "heart" of Node.js. It allows Node.js to handle thousands of operations
//   at the same time, even though JavaScript runs on a single thread.
// - Simple Real-World Analogy (A Restaurant Waiter):
//   Imagine a restaurant with only ONE waiter (Node.js single thread):
//   - Traditional Restaurant (Multi-threaded): Hires one waiter per table. If 50 tables arrive, you
//     need 50 waiters. If tables are just waiting for food, those waiters stand around doing
//     nothing, wasting space and money.
//   - Node.js Restaurant (Event Loop): Has just ONE super-fast waiter. When a table orders, the
//     waiter writes it down, passes it to the kitchen, and immediately moves on to take orders at
//     the next table. When the kitchen finishes a dish, a bell rings (an event), and the waiter
//     delivers it. No time is wasted waiting.
// - Comparison with Multi-Threaded Languages (like Java, C#, or Python):
//   - Traditional Languages: Each incoming client request or operation is assigned to a dedicated
//     OS thread from a pool. If threads run out, requests must wait. Handling massive concurrency
//     requires managing heavy thread overhead and CPU context switching.
//   - Node.js (Single-Threaded Event Loop): Operates primarily on a single main thread. When a
//     heavy or blocking operation occurs (such as reading a file or querying a database), Node.js
//     delegates it to the underlying system kernel or thread pool (libuv) and continues handling
//     other tasks immediately instead of blocking.
// - How the Event Loop Works in Simple Steps:
//   1. Execute Code: Runs your normal, step-by-step synchronous code first.
//   2. Handle Asynchronous Tasks (The Queue): When an asynchronous task finishes (like a timer
//      ending or a file being read), its result goes into a waiting queue.
//   3. The Loop Checks and Executes: The Event Loop constantly checks this queue and runs the
//      waiting callbacks one by one, ensuring nothing gets lost.

//==================================================================================================
// Example
//==================================================================================================

// Simple execution example with setTimeout():
// 1. Runs immediately and prints 'First'.
// 2. Sets a timer for 1 second. Instead of freezing the program, Node.js hands this timer over to
//    the system and moves on instantly.
// 3. Runs immediately and prints 'Third' (demonstrating non-blocking behavior).
// 4. After 1 second passes, the timer finishes, and its function callback is placed in the Event
//    Loop queue.
// 5. The Event Loop picks it up and prints 'Second'.
// - Output: First | Third | Second <- (Processed from Event Loop)

console.log('First');
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Second');
}, 1000);
console.log('Third');
